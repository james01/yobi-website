  A true advertising technology pioneer, Michael laid the framework for many of today’s sophisticated media platforms as early as the mid-1960s. He comes to
  Mediaocean from his role as founder, worldwide chairman and CEO of Donovan Data Systems (DDS), one of Mediaocean’s two founding companies along with
  MediaBank. Born in Panama and raised in Costa Rica and Peru, Michael graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in engineering. He continued his
  studies at MIT with an MS in computers and business. After a year at IBM in New York, in 1965 Michael saw an opportunity to go out on his own as an
  independent programming consultant. Two years later, he started DDS.
